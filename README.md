PHUSE US 2025 Presentation: Maintain quality at scale with Automation + AI enabled testing frameworks

This repository contains the slides for my talk "The R Test Kitchen: Cooking up Quality in Clinical Analytics &amp; Reporting" at PHUSE EU 2024 on Nov 13, 2024 in Strasbourg, France.

# Abstract
In recent years, R has gained popularity in the clinical analytics and reporting space. Ensuring the validity and reliability of R-generated outputs is crucial for making informed, high-impact, clinical decisions based on reports, dashboards, and statistical analyses. This paper demonstrates the powerful ability to automate testing in R using packages like {testthat} and {shinytest}. This versatile framework can be applied to any number of clinical R use cases including R packages, RShiny dashboards, or ad hoc R analyses. We will cover how you can practically incorporate testing into your existing R workflows. Additionally, we will learn how adoption of good testing practices can translate into significant time savings and the delivery of high quality R-based deliverables.
